API project at polimi in 2023

In 2023, a project was conducted at Politecnico di Milano (Polimi) focusing on an optimization challenge centered around finding the shortest path. 
Two distinct iterations of the project were documented through the files "24.c" and "lode.c".
The initial endeavor, encapsulated within "24.c", employed a double-linked list as the primary data structure for addressing the optimization challenge. 
However, recognizing the potential for further enhancement and efficiency, subsequent iterations led to the development of "lode.c".
"Lode.c" represents the culmination of the project, wherein the approach shifted towards utilizing a binary tree as the underlying data structure. 
This transition was likely motivated by the aim to optimize performance and streamline the algorithm's execution.
The project's evolution from "24.c" to "lode.c" underscores a progressive refinement in the chosen data structure, 
indicative of a concerted effort towards achieving greater efficiency and effectiveness in solving the optimization challenge.
